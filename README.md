# No_gARbage

## Inspiration - 
Many pounds of pollution end up in oceans each year making our natural resource a garbage dump. The majority of it comes from human activities along the coastlines and inland. Understanding the devastating effects of pollution on our beaches is the first step to fixing the problem.
Pollution includes plastic, trash, and litter to sewage, pesticides, and oil which contaminate the coasts, it
even effects the human and marine health.

## What it does - 
As most of us use Instagram and Facebook, we thought this could be the best way to reach wide audience and spread the message across the world.**Even though we all are drifted apart by waves we are connected by tech to make it happen** _No gARbage_ is a fun way to educate people about the harmful effects of beach pollution by using AR as a tool for an immersive experience. Our AR game has 3 levels. 
1. Clean the beach
2. Save the turtles
3. Seagull search

## How we built it
We used SparkAR for building immersive AR, 3D and a 360 degree games which made up our three levels. Blender for building the 3D models.

## Challenges we ran into
There were very few working codes from 2020 for Spark AR. Thus, we had to manually modify and recreate our own codes. 
The Spark AR application was very hard to work with. 
All of us were completely new to Spark AR. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to bring some awareness with these games and social message.

## What we learned
We learned how to make an immersive AR game using a technology we have never used before

## What's next for No gARbage
We will be deploying it to instagram and facebook so that the audience can start using it and it'll reach everyone and hoping to bring a change!
